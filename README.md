# Effect-of-Air-Quality-on-Public-Health
In this short study, we investigated the impact of air quality on public health using a neural network model on a highly imbalanced multi-class dataset. For this problem, we leveraged snapshot ensembles using cyclic learning rate schedules (e.g., cosine annealing) to improve generalization and stability. The dataset for the project was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/air-quality-and-health-impact-dataset
