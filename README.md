# Effect-of-Air-Quality-on-Public-Health
## Project aims and description:
In this short study, we investigated the impact of air quality on public health using a neural network model on a highly imbalanced multi-class dataset. For this problem, we leveraged snapshot ensembles using cyclic learning rate schedules (e.g., cosine annealing) to improve generalization and stability. The dataset for the project was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/air-quality-and-health-impact-dataset.

## Conclusion and recommendation:
We have shown that employing snapshot ensembles leads to enhanced stability in performance and better generalization. For this brief study, we achieved an accuracy of 95.6%, which is satisfactory and comparable to the results obtained by other participants on Kaggle. There is still room for experimentation, and I believe accuracy can be improved further by investigating other ensemble methods.
